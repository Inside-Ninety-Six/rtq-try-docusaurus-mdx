The full price of a car is $\pounds 12000$. The car is in a sale and its price has been reduced by $35\%$. 

Monique is saving up to buy the car. She already has $\pounds 7350$. How much more money does she need to buy the car? 

</div>
<div class='workings'>
<div class='working'>

If the price is reduced by $35 \%$, then the sale price will be $100 - 35 = 65 \%$ of the original price. Using that we get,

$
\begin {aligned}
\text {New price}   &= 65 \% \ \text {of} \ \pounds 12000 \\\\
                    &= \dfrac {65} {100} \times 12000 \\\\
                    &= \dfrac {65 \times 12000} {100} \\\\
                    &= \dfrac {65 \times 120 \cancel {00}} {1 \cancel {00}} \\\\
                    &= 65 \times 120 \\\\
                    &= \pounds 7800
\end {aligned}
$

The new price for the car $= 7800$.

$
\begin {aligned}
\text {Money she needs}   &= 7800 - 7350 \\\\
                          &= \pounds 450
\end {aligned}
$

Monique needs $\pounds 450$ more to buy the car.

If One-third of the girls are writing with pen, then the number of girls writing with pencil will be $1 - \dfrac {1} {3} = \dfrac {2} {3}$. Using that we get,

Tanya cuts out a piece of card into a rectangle. The rectangle is twice as long as it is wide. 
The area of the rectangle is $128 \ \text{cm}^2$.

What is the perimeter of rectangle?

</div>
<div class='workings'>
<div class='working'>

Let the width of the rectangle $= a$.

As per the question, 

Length of the rectangle $= 2a$. 

$
\begin {aligned}
\text {Area of the rectangle}   &= \text {length} \times \text {width} \\\\
128                             &= 2a \times a \\\\
2a ^ 2                          &= 128 \\\\
a ^ 2                           &= \dfrac {128} {2} \\\\
a ^ 2                           &= \dfrac {64 \times 2} {2} \\\\
a ^ 2                           &= \dfrac {64 \times \cancel {2}} {\cancel {2}} \\\\
a ^ 2                           &= 64 \\\\
a                               &= \sqrt {64} \\\\
a                               &= 8
\end {aligned}
$

Width of the rectangle $= 8 \ \text {cm}$, length of the rectangle $2 \times 8 = 16 \ \text {cm}$.

$
\begin {aligned}
\text {Perimeter of rectangle}  &= 2 (\text {length} + \text {width}) \\\\
                                &= 2 \times (16 + 8) \\\\
                                &= 2 \times 24 \\\\
                                &= 48 \ \text {cm}

Robin and Susan are playing a game with nine cards. The cards are numbered from $1$ to $9$ as shown below.

$\boxed{\huge { \text{ 1 }}}$
$\boxed{\huge { \text{ 2 }}}$
$\boxed{\huge { \text{ 3 }}}$
$\boxed{\huge { \text{ 4 }}}$
$\boxed{\huge { \text{ 5 }}}$
$\boxed{\huge { \text{ 6 }}}$
$\boxed{\huge { \text{ 7 }}}$
$\boxed{\huge { \text{ 8 }}}$
$\boxed{\huge { \text{ 9 }}}$

Robin and Susan take turns to pick up one card each. They keep all the cards they have picked up so far. 
The winner is the first player who can make a total of $15$ out of the cards in their hand.

Susan starts the first game. She picks the $6$ first, and Robin then picks the $3$. Next Susan picks the $4$, 
and Robin picks the $5$. For her third card, Susan picks the $7$, and then Robin picks the $9$. Finally, Susan picks the $2$.

Susan now has the cards  

$\boxed{\huge { \text{ 2 }}}$
$\boxed{\huge { \text{ 4 }}}$
$\boxed{\huge { \text{ 6 }}}$
$\boxed{\huge { \text{ 7 }}}$
in her hand.

Susan wins because she can use three of her cards to make a total of $15$:

$2 + 6 + 7 = 15$

Robin starts the second game. After two turns each, Robin is holding the cards numbered $6$ and $4$, 
and Susan is holding the cards numbered $2$ and $5$. It is Robin's turn to pick up a card.

Robin decides to pick up the card numbered $8$.

Why do you think this is a good move?

Who will win this game? Explain your answer carefully.
