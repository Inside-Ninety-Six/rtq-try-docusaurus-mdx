One angle of a triangle is $30 \degree$. The second angle is twice the size of the third. What is the largest angle?

</div>
<div class='workings'>
<div class='working'>

Let the third angle $= a$

As per the question, the second angle $= 2a$

As we know, the sum of angles in a triangle is $180 \degree$. So,

$
\begin{aligned}
a + 2a + 30     &= 180  \\\\
3a + 30         &= 180  \\\\
3a              &= 180 - 30  \\\\
3a              &= 150  \\\\
a               &= \dfrac {150} {3}  \\\\
a               &= \dfrac {50 \times 3} {3}  \\\\
a               &= \dfrac {50 \times \cancel{3}}{\cancel{3}}   \\\\
a               &= 50 \degree
\end{aligned}
$

We know the size of the third angle now. 
However, we need to find the largest angle which is the second angle.

$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Largest angle} &= 2a  \\\\
&= 2 \times 50  \\\\
&= 100  \degree

Neil lends Rodger $\pounds 4$. Rodger pays back $30 \%$ of this the next day. How much does he still owe Neil?

</div>
<div class='workings'>
<div class='working'>

Let's convert pounds to pence.

$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Total amount} &= \pounds 4 \\\\
&= 4 \times 100 \text{p} \\\\
&= 400 \text{p}
\end{aligned}
$

Rodger pays back $30 \%$. So,

$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Amount paid} &= 30\% \text{ of } 400 \\\\
&= \dfrac {30} {100} \times 400 \\\\
&= \dfrac {30 \times 400} {100} \\\\
&= \dfrac {30 \times 4 \cancel{0} \cancel{0}} {1 \cancel{0} \cancel{0}} \\\\
&= 30 \times 4 \\\\
&= 120  \text{p} 
\end{aligned}
$

Let's calculate the amount Rodger still owes Neil.

$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Amount owed} &= 400 - 120 \\\\
&= 280 \text{p} \\\\
&= \pounds 2.80
\end{aligned}
$

</div>
<div class='working'>

Can we do better than the previous solution? 

If Rodger has paid back $30\%$ of the money, he still has $70\%$ to pay. 
So we can directly calculate the amount owed and save on calculating the amount paid as well.

$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Amount owed} &= 70\% \text{ of } 400 \\\\
&= \dfrac {70} {100} \times 400 \\\\
&= \dfrac {70 \times 400} {100} \\\\
&= \dfrac {70 \times 4 \cancel{0} \cancel{0}} {1 \cancel{0} \cancel{0}} \\\\
&= 70 \times 4 \\\\
&= 280 \\\\
&= 280 \text{p} \\\\
&= \pounds 2.80

Nigel spent $\pounds 71$ on CDs, some costing $\pounds 8$ each, and the rest $\pounds 5$ each. He bought more of the dearer ones. How many CDs did he buy altogether?

</div>
<div class='workings'>
<div class='working'>

Let the count of the expensive CDs $= d$

Let the count of the cheaper CDs $= c$

As per the question,

$
\begin{aligned}
8d + 5c     &= 71 \\\\
d           &> c
\end{aligned}
$

We have got $2$ variables and so we need $2$ equations to solve them. 
Here we have got $2$ equations but the second one is an inequality equation, so we 
can't use elimination or substitution to solve the equations.

This can be solved instead by using trial and error but applying conditions to narrow down options.

We know $d > c$, so let's start with the biggest value possible for $d$.
If $d$ is $9$, that will equate to $8 \times 9 = 72$ and thats more than total spent $71$, so the biggest possible value for $d$ is $8$.


Let's try for $d = 8$.

$
\begin{aligned}
8d + 5c             &= 71 \\\\
8 \times 8 + 5c     &= 71 \\\\
64 + 5c             &= 71 \\\\
5c                  &= 71 - 64 \\\\
5c                  &= 7
\end{aligned}
$

$7$ is not exactly divisible by $5$ and so this value of $d$ is not the solution.

Let's try for $d = 7$.

$
\begin{aligned}
8d + 5c             &= 71 \\\\
8 \times 7 + 5c     &= 71 \\\\
56 + 5c             &= 71 \\\\
5c                  &= 71 - 56 \\\\
5c                  &= 15 \\\\
c                   &= \dfrac{15}{5} \\\\
c                   &= \dfrac{5 \times 3}{5} \\\\
c                   &= \dfrac{\cancel{5} \times 3}{\cancel{5}} \\\\
c                   &= 3
\end{aligned}
$

For $d = 7$, we have a solution where $c = 3$ and it satisfies the inequality $d > c$ too. So we have our solution.

Let's find the total CDs count.

$
\begin{aligned}
c                    &= 3 \\\\
d                    &= 7 \\\\
\text{Total CDs}     &= 7 + 3 \\\\
                     &= 10
\end{aligned}
$

<!--
Bebs explanation

We know that the total of the CDs was $\pounds 71. If we name the number of the more expensive CDs a and the cheaper CDs b, we can form an equation.
8a + 5b = 71
a > b
As the cost of the cheaper CDs are $\pounds 5, however many of these CDs Nigel buys, the cost of them will always be a multiple of 5. This means it will end in 5 or 0.
If $\pounds 71 and the total cost of the expensive CDs Nigel buys, don't subtract to a result which is a multiple of 5, some money would be left over.
This means that we need to find which numbers the cost of the expensive CDs could end with so all the $\pounds 71 is spent.
To get from 71 to a number ending with 0, you could subtract 1.
To get from 71 to a number ending with 5, you could subtract 6.
This means that the total cost of the expensive CDs will either end in the number 6 or 1. We now need to find a multiple of 8 ending in 6 0r 1 which is less than 71.
8 * 1 = 8 (doesn't end in 6 or 1)
8 * 2 = 16 (ends in 6)
8 * 3 = 24 (doesn't end in 6 or 1)
8 * 4 = 32 (doesn't end in 6 or 1)
8 * 5 = 40 (doesn't end in 6 or 1)
8 * 6 = 48 (doesn't end in 6 or 1)
8 * 7 = 56 (ends in 6)
8 * 8 = 64 (doesn't end in 6 or 1)
8 * 9 = 72 (greater than 71)
8 * 10 = 80 (greater than 71)
We have now discovered that there are either 2 or 7 of the more expensive CDs.
If there were 2, the cost of them would be $\pounds 16. This would mean that the cost of the cheaper CDs would be $\pounds 71 - $\pounds 16 which is $\pounds 55. There would be 11 of the cheaper CDs.
However, the questions states that he bought more of the dearer (more expensive) CDs. This means that he bought 7 of the more expensive CDs which would cost $\pounds 56. The cost of the cheaper CDs would be $\pounds 71 - $\pounds 56 which is $\pounds 15. There would be 3 of the cheaper CDs.
We need to find the total number of the CDs which would be 7 + 3 which is 10 CDs.

answer = 10

d = 7
c = 3

Total CDs = 7 + 3

= 10 CDs

Adam ran $3 \ \text{kilometres}$ in $13 \ \text{minutes}$. Jackie started $30 \ \text{seconds}$ after him and finished $30 \  \text{seconds}$ before him. What was Jackie's speed in kilometres per hour?

</div>
<div class='workings'>
<div class='working'>

It is really important to use the right units in calculations and convert where required. The time is given in minutes and seconds and the final speed has to be in kilometres per hour.

Distance $= 3 \ \text{km}$

Since Jackie started $30 \ \text{seconds}$ after and finished $30 \  \text{seconds}$ earlier, so,

$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Time taken}   &= 13 \ \text{minutes} - 30 \text{s} - 30 \text{s} \\\\
                    &= 13 \ \text{minutes} - 60 \text{s} \\\\
                    &= 13 \ \text{minutes} - 1 \ \text{minute} \\\\
                    &= 12 \ \text{minutes} \\\\
                    &= \dfrac {12} {60} \ \text{hours}
\end{aligned}
$

Let's find the speed now.

$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Speed}      &= \dfrac {\text{Distance}} {\text{Time}} \\\\
                  &= \dfrac {3} { \dfrac {12}{60} } \ \text{km/hour} \\\\
                  &= \dfrac {3 \times 60} {12} \ \text{km/hour} \\\\
                  &= \dfrac {3 \times 5 \times 12} {12} \ \text{km/hour} \\\\
                  &= \dfrac {3 \times 5 \times \cancel{12}} {\cancel{12}} \ \text{km/hour} \\\\
                  &= 15 \ \text{km/hour}
\end{aligned}
$

</div>
<div class='working'>

We can also use ratio to find the speed from the distance and time. 

$
\begin{aligned}
3 \ \text{km}               &: 12 \ \text{minutes} \\\\
3 \times 5 \ \text{km}      &: 12 \times 5 \ \text{minutes} \\\\
15 \ \text{km}              &: 60 \ \text{minutes} \\\\
15 \ \text{km}              &: 1 \ \text{hour}

</div>
<div class='workings'>
<div class='working'>

Let's first find LCM for three numbers. There are no common factors, so the LCM would be 

$
\begin{aligned}
\text{LCM}              &= 2 \times 3 \times 5 \\\\
                        &= 30

Now let's find the largest number that is a multiple of the LCM and is less than $100$.

$
\begin{aligned}
30 \times 2 &= 60   && \text{less than 100} \\\\
30 \times 3 &= 90   && \text{less than 100} \\\\
30 \times 4 &= 120  && \text{greater than 100}

Geraint starts from $3$ and counts up in fours, so he 
says $3, 7, 11, \ldots$ and so on. David starts from $6$ and 
counts up in sevens. What is the smallest number that both boys say?

</div>
<div class='workings'>
<div class='working'>

This can easily be solved by counting the first few numbers from each sequence.

Geraint counts up in fours, so

$3, \quad 7, \quad 11, \quad 15, \quad 19, \quad 23, \quad 27, \quad 31, \quad \ldots$

David counts up in sevens, so

$6, \quad 13, \quad 20, \quad 27, \quad \ldots$

Smallest common number $= 27$

INFER_DESCRIPTION_STARTS Needs more work to simplify INFER_DESCRIPTION_ENDS

We found the common term quite easily in the above solution. 
But if the common term happens to be further down in the list, the above 
approach may require more effort to find the common term. 

Let's try to solve the problem in a more formal (but longer) way.

The difference between each consecutive term is constant for both the lists and hence these 
are arithmetic sequences. The formula of an arithmetic sequence whose 
first term is $a$, common difference is $d$ and $n$ is any term number is given as:

$a + d(n-1)$

Let's find the formula for the two sequences.

Geraint counts up in fours, starting with $3$. Hence,

First sequence $= 3 + 4(m - 1)$

David counts up in sevens, starting with $6$. Hence,

Second sequence $= 6 + 7(n - 1)$

Now we can find the smallest common term between the two sequences.

$
\begin{aligned}
3 + 4(m - 1)        &= 6 + 7(n - 1) \\\\
3 + 4m - 4          &= 6 + 7n - 7 \\\\
4m - 1              &= 7n - 1 \\\\
4m                  &= 7n - 1 + 1 \\\\
4m                  &= 7n  \\\\
m                   &= \dfrac{7n} { 4}
\end{aligned}
$

We can see from the above equation, that the smallest integral value for $m$ will be when $n = 4$.
In other words, the first common element between the two sequences will be for $n = 4$.

substituting value for $n = 4$,

$
\begin{aligned}
&= 6 + 7(n - 1) \\\\
&= 6 + 7n - 7 \\\\
&= 7n - 1 \\\\
&= 7 \times 4 - 1 \\\\
&= 28 - 1 \\\\
&= 27
\end{aligned}

Smallest common number $= 27$

A bull and three cows costs $\pounds 1300$. Four bulls and eight cows cost $\pounds4000$. What is the cost of a bull?

</div>
<div class='workings'>
<div class='working'>

Let the cost of a bull (in $\text{\pounds}$) $= b$

Let the cost of a cow (in $\text{\pounds}$) $= c$

As per the question,

$
\begin{aligned} 
b + 3c      &= 1300   \\\\
4b + 8c     &= 4000         
\end{aligned}
$

There are two variables, $b$ and $c$. Let's eliminate to reduce it to just one variable. Multiply the first equation by $4$ to eliminate $b$.

$
\begin{aligned} 
b + 3c                      &= 1300             \\\\
4 \times b + 4 \times 3c    &= 4 \times 1300    \\\\
4b + 12c                    &= 5200
\end{aligned}
$

Subtract the second equation from the first to reduce it to one variable.

$
\begin{aligned}
4b + 12c                    &= 5200 \\\\
4b + 8c                     &= 4000 \\\\
4b + 12c - (4b + 8c)        &= 5200 - 4000 \\\\
4b + 12c - 4b - 8c          &= 5200 - 4000 \\\\
4c                          &= 1200 \\\\
c                           &= \dfrac{1200}{4} \\\\
c                           &= \pounds 300
\end{aligned}
$

Cost of a cow $= \pounds 300$. 

Let's substitute the value of $c$ in one of the initial equations to find the cost of a bull.

$
\begin{aligned} 
b + 3c                      &= 1300  \\\\
b + 3 \times 300            &= 1300 \\\\
b + 900                     &= 1300 \\\\
b                           &= 1300 - 900 \\\\
b                           &= \pounds 400
\end{aligned}
$

Cost of a bull $= \pounds 400$.

</div>
<div class='working'>

Can we do better than the previous solution? If we look at the question, we only have to find the cost of a bull. 
In the previous solution, we first found the cost of a cow and then we used that to find the cost of a bull.
We can eliminate $c$ instead to directly find the cost of a bull.

Let the cost of a bull in pounds $= b$

Let the cost of a cow in pounds $= c$

Let's eliminate again to reduce it to just one variable $b$. The LCM of $8$ and $3$ is $24$. 
Multiply the first equation by $8$ and the second equation by $3$ to make the coeifficent of $c$ the same.

$
\begin{aligned} 
b + 3c                      &= 1300          \\\\
4b + 8c                     &= 4000          \\\\
8 \times b + 8 \times 3c    &= 8 \times 1300 \\\\
3 \times 4b + 3 \times 8c   &= 3 \times 4000  \\\\
8b + 24c                    &= 10400 \\\\
12b + 24c                   &= 12000
\end{aligned}
$

Subtract the first equation from the second to reduce it to one variable.

$
\begin{aligned}
8b + 24c                    &= 10400 \\\\
12b + 24c                   &= 12000 \\\\
12b + 24c - (8b + 24c)      &= 12000 - 10400 \\\\
12b + 24c - 8b - 24c        &= 12000 - 10400 \\\\
4b                          &= 1600             \\\\
b                           &= \dfrac{1600}{4} \\\\
b                           &= \pounds 400
